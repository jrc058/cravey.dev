# John Cravey

I am John.

Long time private-lifer, first time public-lifer. Well, that's not true. I've had several websites in the past, scrapped them, and now starting from scratch after a long absence.

I don't do social media, you will not find trackers on this website, no affiliate links, no ads, no frills. Just me and my thoughts in a public light experiment.

My interests you'll find on this site are a lot of self-hosting services, homelabs, home projects, pi projects, voiding manufacturer warranties, local LLM inference, cyberdeck, websites, and more.

I like knowledge networks. I have thousands of notes in obsidian notes and am working my damndest to externalize thoughts and make a second brain.

This is and will always be a work in progress, which is typical of my projects. I break a lot of eggs to make omelettes.

The below is in zero order. Order of first come first serve from my notes.
