# Projects

This portfolio is a mix of professional and enthusiast work.

I enjoy a lot of different work, at different levels of skill. My background in website building is fairly amateur, and most any other code is vibe-coded with the aid of Amazon Kiro, Google Gemini, and my local LLMs, usually qwen3:14b.

The aid of AI has had immense impact on my continuing education. The military abstained from AI when I was in it, and at the time I got out of the military the landscape of AI had completely changed. Where a lot of peers felt boy-who-cried-wolf about AI and dismissed later generations, I got the chance to dive in during a major leap in the LLM space.

So, I incorporated it into everything, quickly. I started [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes and pretty quickly let Kiro run loose in that vault. That led to a lot of file creation and a lot of slop, admittedly. It probably didn't even save time, at first, maybe. However, it was a project multiplier.

All of my projects I have always had backburnered immediately bubbled up and saw light. The computer I replaced became a server, and the new computer was my workstation for all of two months before I turned my new computer into the server because I needed more. Just more. 

Now, my homelab hosts:

Self-hosting a server has led me to a world of understanding that no one could have ever taught me. And AI does the heavy lifting, because time is hard to come by. Even when I started using Linux 15 years ago, I still always just googled commands to copy and paste into the command line... so nothing's changed.

There's been hours of correcting slop, and hours of having to go into the developer's docs. It's not a set-it-and-forget-it workflow, using AI at this stage.

But step-by-step, walking hand-in-hand with AI, I correct it, it corrects my understanding, there's corrections on both sides. And that correction from the other side, pooling for trained data of documentation and other user use cases, has multiplied my project productivity, even outside of just the server.

The wife and I made a deep water culture garden, which was really set up from a few DIY instruction sites, but a lot of the maintenance is led by AI.
