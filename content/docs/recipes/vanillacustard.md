# 🍽 Vanilla Custard -> 
It's a favorite. Costco ice cream is close, but this homemade custard is the best sweet treat in the world. It's a tedious process and would probably be improved by getting the Kitchen-Aid specific bowl attachment, but right now we have the Kitchen-Aid countertop ice cream spinner thing that works.
