# John

Professionally I've worn many hats from my current role at Amazon in Customer Success, my previos role as a Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Advisor in the military, and if you go back far enough I did door-to-door sales, snowbummed in Vail, volunteered for an earth home project, and a lot in between.

Unprofessionally, I still wear many hats. Almost all towards digital sovereignty and privacy advocacy, and anything for self-sustaining and building a worldly skillset that can apply to most any project I take on.
