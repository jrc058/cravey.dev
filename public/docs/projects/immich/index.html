href=#immich-photo-management>#</a></h1><p>Google Photos is convenient until you realize they have every photo you&rsquo;ve ever taken. I wanted that convenience without giving up my privacy, so I deployed <a href=https://immich.app/>Immich</a>—a self-hosted photo management system that looks and feels like Google Photos but runs local.</p><p>The interface is nearly identical to commercial photo services. Upload photos, automatic organization, facial recognition, albums, sharing—all the features you&rsquo;d expect. The difference is that everything stays on my hardware, and I control who has access.</p><h2 id=how-it-works>How It Works<a class=anchor href=#how-it-works>#</a></h2><p>Immich runs as a set of Docker containers on my home server. There&rsquo;s the main server, a PostgreSQL database for metadata, a machine learning container for facial recognition and object detection, and a Redis cache for performance. It&rsquo;s more complex than some of my other services, but the architecture makes sense once you understand what each piece does.</p><p>The mobile app connects to my server and automatically backs up photos in the background. I can browse my entire library from my phone, create albums, and share links to specific collections. When I take photos at a family event, I create a shared album and send a link—anyone with that link can view and download the original images with no compression. Anyone in my family knows how much I hate compression over texting. Pictures should never be sent over text.</p><p>Storage lives on my server&rsquo;s data drive, with the actual photo files separate from the database. This makes backups straightforward and means I can move the photos to different storage if needed without rebuilding the database.</p><h2 id=working-with-kiro>Working with Kiro<a class=anchor href=#working-with-kiro>#</a></h2><p>Setting up Immich was more involved than simpler services like Navidrome. The multi-container architecture meant coordinating several services and making sure they could all talk to each other. Kiro helped me understand the Docker Compose configuration and how the containers network together.</p><p>We hit a snag with the admin interface freezing the browser. Turns out it was a bug in the version I was running—the backend was fine, but the frontend JavaScript had an issue. Kiro helped me troubleshoot by checking logs and testing different scenarios until we figured out it was a known bug fixed in a newer version. Updating solved it.</p><p>Password resets were another learning experience. When I locked myself out of an account (guilty), we had to go directly into the PostgreSQL database to reset the password. Kiro walked me through generating a bcrypt hash and updating the database safely, which taught me more about how authentication works under the hood.</p><h2 id=what-i-learned>What I Learned<a class=anchor href=#what-i-learned>#</a></h2><p>Facial recognition on your own hardware is surprisingly good. Immich&rsquo;s machine learning container can identify people in photos and group them automatically. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s good enough to be useful, and it all happens locally without sending photos to some cloud service.</p><p>The mobile app is solid. Background uploads work reliably, and the interface is responsive. It feels like using a commercial app, which is rare for self-hosted software.</p><p>Sharing is well-designed. You can create a link to an album that expires after a certain time or number of views. People can view and download photos without needing an account. It&rsquo;s exactly what I need for sharing event photos with family. I have not set up users outside of me and my wife, but I have been trying to persuade my family to migrate to my server for all their photos, too. If I win that battle, I will create users and manage permissions a bit better than I am now, but I would be happy to take all their data off of Apple and Google servers. I need more comfortable redundancy, though.</p><p>Database management matters. When things go wrong, knowing how to access the PostgreSQL database directly is valuable. It&rsquo;s not something you do often, but when you need it, you really need it.</p><h2 id=why-it-matters>Why It Matters<a class=anchor href=#why-it-matters>#</a></h2><p>This project is about taking back control of personal data. Every photo I take doesn&rsquo;t need to be analyzed by Google&rsquo;s AI or used to train their models. The photos are mine, stored on my hardware, accessible only to people I choose.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also about long-term ownership. Cloud services change terms, raise prices, or shut down. With Immich, I own the infrastructure. If the project disappeared tomorrow, I&rsquo;d still have all my photos and could migrate to something else.</p><p>The system has become essential for family events. Instead of texting compressed photos or using some sketchy file-sharing service, I create an Immich album and share a link. Everyone gets the full-resolution originals, and I can see who&rsquo;s accessed the album.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div></div><div></div></div><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><span><a href=/docs/projects/homeassistant/ class="flex align-center"><img src=/icons/backward.svg class=book-icon alt=Backward>
