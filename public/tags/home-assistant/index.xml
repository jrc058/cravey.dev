&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/"&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt; is a great tool for smart automations, run locally. I learned more about my data and my home from using Home Assistant more than most things. It can be really plug and play or super customizable depending on how you are, which might be a turn off for most, wife approval is a leading cause of failed Home Assistant projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project started with help from Kiro, and somewhere along the line became a fun project to use local LLMs for, as well as learning some JSON myself, though I am partial to GUI.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
