&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cyberdecktech.com"&gt;CyberDeck Tech&lt;/a&gt; is a project dedicated to exploring the philosophy of cyberdecks and digital sovereignty. It serves as a curated digital garden for ideas around privacy-first mobile computing and local AI inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Jekyll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ReactJS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vibe coded with Amazon Kiro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="site-creation"&gt;Site Creation&lt;a class="anchor" href="#site-creation"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central concept of the site are obsidian notes I made about the Steam Deck and cyberdecks as a whole- the ecosystem of a touch screen device that is not vendor locked to a mobile operating system, with a novel form factor that has potential for more utility.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cravey.dev/docs/projects/homeassistant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cravey.dev/docs/projects/homeassistant/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="home-assistant-smart-home"&gt;Home Assistant Smart Home&lt;a class="anchor" href="#home-assistant-smart-home"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/"&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt; is a great tool for smart automations, run locally. I learned more about my data and my home from using Home Assistant more than most things. It can be really plug and play or super customizable depending on how you are, which might be a turn off for most, wife approval is a leading cause of failed Home Assistant projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project started with help from Kiro, and somewhere along the line became a fun project to use local LLMs for, as well as learning some JSON myself, though I am partial to GUI.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cravey.dev/docs/projects/immich/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cravey.dev/docs/projects/immich/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="immich-photo-management"&gt;Immich Photo Management&lt;a class="anchor" href="#immich-photo-management"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Photos is convenient until you realize they have every photo you&amp;rsquo;ve ever taken. I wanted that convenience without giving up my privacy, so I deployed &lt;a href="https://immich.app/"&gt;Immich&lt;/a&gt;—a self-hosted photo management system that looks and feels like Google Photos but runs local.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface is nearly identical to commercial photo services. Upload photos, automatic organization, facial recognition, albums, sharing—all the features you&amp;rsquo;d expect. The difference is that everything stays on my hardware, and I control who has access.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cravey.dev/docs/projects/miniflux/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cravey.dev/docs/projects/miniflux/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="miniflux-rss"&gt;Miniflux RSS&lt;a class="anchor" href="#miniflux-rss"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really not a fan of news and social feeds. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone on and off of RSS since 2010ish, trying different readers and whatnot, but always ending up at a different feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://miniflux.app/"&gt;Miniflux&lt;/a&gt; is nice, it does everything any RSS reader does, but gives a lot more flexibility because it&amp;rsquo;s its own backend. The global feed is manageable and the categories are clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexibility comes in writing feed-specific rules.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cravey.dev/docs/projects/ollama/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cravey.dev/docs/projects/ollama/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="local-ai-with-ollama-and-open-webui"&gt;Local AI with Ollama and Open WebUI&lt;a class="anchor" href="#local-ai-with-ollama-and-open-webui"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running AI models locally instead of sending every query to OpenAI or Anthropic was the goal. &lt;a href="https://ollama.ai/"&gt;Ollama&lt;/a&gt; makes it possible to run large language models on your own hardware, and &lt;a href="https://openwebui.com/"&gt;Open WebUI&lt;/a&gt; provides a ChatGPT-like interface for interacting with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup means I can experiment with AI without worrying about API costs, rate limits, or sending sensitive data to third parties. The models run entirely on my server, using the GPU for acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
