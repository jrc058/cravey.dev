Almost all towards digital sovereignty and privacy advocacy, and anything for self-sustaining and building a worldly skillset that can apply to most any project I take on.\nLinks# linkedin \u0026hellip; and that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much it. email john@cravey.dev\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/portfolio/","title":"Portfolio","section":"Docs","content":"Portfolio# This portfolio is a mix of professional and enthusiast work.\nI enjoy a lot of different work, at different levels of skill. My background in website building is fairly amateur, and most any other code is vibe-coded with the aid of Amazon Kiro, Google Gemini, and my local LLMs, usually qwen3:14b.\nThe aid of AI has had immense impact on my continuing education. The military abstained from AI when I was in it, and at the time I got out of the military the landscape of AI had completely changed. Where a lot of peers felt boy-who-cried-wolf about AI and dismissed later generations, I got the chance to dive in during a major leap in the LLM space.\nSo, I incorporated it into everything, quickly. I started Obsidian notes and pretty quickly let Kiro run loose in that vault. That led to a lot of file creation and a lot of slop, admittedly. It probably didn\u0026rsquo;t even save time, at first, maybe. However, it was a project multiplier.\nAll of my projects I have always had backburnered immediately bubbled up and saw light. The computer I replaced became a server, and the new computer was my workstation for all of two months before I turned my new computer into the server because I needed more. Just more.\nNow, my homelab hosts:\nHome Assistant Zigbee2MQTT ZwaveJS Immich OpenWebui (potentially changing to llms.py) Navidrome Ollama Searxng instance WebDav Jellyfin Miniflux Code-server Minecraft server Fun project to get my nephew\u0026rsquo;s Bedrock game to my Java game with geyser and floodgate Homarr Syncthing Wyoming Openwakeword, piper, whisper Calibre Web Rotki Several websites \u0026hellip; and the list goes to a revolving doors of projects I\u0026rsquo;ve tried, like; fava/beancount ghostfolio and more Self-hosting a server has led me to a world of understanding that no one could have ever taught me. And AI does the heavy lifting, because time is hard to come by. Even when I started using Linux 15 years ago, I still always just googled commands to copy and paste into the command line\u0026hellip; so nothing\u0026rsquo;s changed.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s been hours of correcting slop, and hours of having to go into the developer\u0026rsquo;s docs. It\u0026rsquo;s not a set-it-and-forget-it workflow, using AI at this stage.\nBut step-by-step, walking hand-in-hand with AI, I correct it, it corrects my understanding, there\u0026rsquo;s corrections on both sides. And that correction from the other side, pooling for trained data of documentation and other user use cases, has multiplied my project productivity, even outside of just the server.\nThe wife and I made a deep water culture garden, which was really set up from a few DIY instruction sites, but a lot of the maintenance is led by AI.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/posts/","title":"Posts","section":"Docs","content":"Not sure how to create a static page here to dynamically display current posts.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/portfolio/cyberdecktech/","title":"CyberDeck Tech","section":"Portfolio","content":"CyberDeck Tech# CyberDeck Tech is a project dedicated to exploring the philosophy of cyberdecks and digital sovereignty. It serves as a curated digital garden for ideas around privacy-first mobile computing and local AI inference.\nTechnologies Used# Jekyll ReactJS Vibe coded with Amazon Kiro Site Creation# The central concept of the site are obsidian notes I made about the Steam Deck and cyberdecks as a whole- the ecosystem of a touch screen device that is not vendor locked to a mobile operating system, with a novel form factor that has potential for more utility.\nI handed my notes over to Amazon Kiro and it generated several files to design the architecture of the website, and then let it loose with react and jekyll to build the site. The humble beginnings visually look very similar to how it remains. The largest amount of edits and rebuilds were for the Map of Content navigation for the \u0026ldquo;connected concepts\u0026rdquo; navigation, the hover elements, and the tile cards to look like terminal UIs.\nIt probably took 20 solid iterations of rebuilding the site, of reworking major portions of it, then a lot of random tweaking for small edits, but over the course of a week it was done without me actually writing any of the code. The most technical extent I went to was pulling up the developer console on a browser to copy and paste error codes into Kiro for Kiro to diagnose the problems and create a solution.\nSite Result# Aside from some JS bugs, the site seems to load pretty well. It\u0026rsquo;s chunked in blocks that dynamically load so the whole website doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to load at once and it can be served faster. Should probably run a benchmark to see if it\u0026rsquo;s fast, but it\u0026rsquo;s fast and responsive so I haven\u0026rsquo;t really touched it since.\nIt was made to be an ongoing post and publication, but it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty niche project that I work on and I\u0026rsquo;m happy having it as a more static content site for the project than anything. It\u0026rsquo;s less so the project, and really more the core concept of why advocating for cyberdecks is pro sovereignty and releases us from vendor lock.\nFuture State# I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I like the concept of cyberdecks. I continue to make changes to my Steam Deck in line with the philosophy, I just don\u0026rsquo;t update the site. The workflow is kind of convoluted, and I should migrate it to my current workflow on code-server and goose cli, once I migrate it into the same workflow I use for cravey.dev I will likely compartmentalize publications better and be able to update it more easily.\n"}]
